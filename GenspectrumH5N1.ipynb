    "#### Goal: Use as many H5N1 sequences from NCBI as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "Current steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can recreate the findings of this notebook by using the `loculus-ingest` pipeline and running `snakemake process_alignments`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download H5N1 datasets using the NCBI CLI tool. Sadly, there used to exist a H5N1 taxon, but this is no longer used. The best approach is to now use NCBI virus to filter Influenza A based on genotype, however the CLI does not have this option. (They are working on genotype/serotype based filtering), until then I filter Influenza A based on if the sequences contain H5N1 in their title. (See https://github.com/ncbi/datasets/issues/407 for details, they suggest using taxonId 2955291, but this has no impact on the final results). We download all sequences from taxonId 197911 = 1'129'000 sequences total (as of October 14, 2024), for comparison taxonId 2955291 = 1'128'989.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "datasets download virus genome taxon 197911 --no-progressbar --filename results/ncbi_dataset.zip \n",
    "unzip -jp results/ncbi_dataset.zip ncbi_dataset/data/genomic.fna | seqkit seq -w0  > results/sequences.fasta\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Filter out sequences which do not have H5N1 in their title: \"results/sequences_filtered.fasta\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I also download the accessions of all H5N1 genotypes shown on NCBI virus from the webpage: \"H5N1_accession_list.tsv\". For comparison, alternatively I could use the datasets CLI to download only the sequences in this list, but this would require continuous updating.\n"
